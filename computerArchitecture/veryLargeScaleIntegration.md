![floorPlanning](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFGIuc4iINQ/XhLu6AXgATI/AAAAAAAAAZE/y5fSPKm40aUVWlvJ0UYUrHSbzZHeuZeIgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/2.jpg)

Floorplanning in VLSI is the process of determining the physical placement of functional blocks on a chip. The goal of floorplanning is to optimize the performance, area, and power consumption of the chip while satisfying all design constraints.

Floorplanning is a complex task because there are many factors to consider, such as:
- The size and shape of the chip
- The number and type of functional blocks
- The connectivity between the functional blocks
- The performance, area, and power constraints

Floorplanning is typically done using a **computer-aided design (CAD)** tool. The CAD tool takes the design constraints as input and generates a floorplan that meets those constraints.

The floorplan also takes into account the following factors:
- Power consumption: The floorplan is designed to minimize the power consumption of the chip.
- Testability: The floorplan is designed to make it easy to test the chip.

Here are some of the benefits of floorplanning:
- Improved performance: Floorplanning Wcan help to reduce wire delay and clock skew, which can improve the performance of the chip.
- Reduced area: Floorplanning can help to reduce the area of the chip by optimizing the placement of the functional blocks.
- Reduced power consumption: Floorplanning can help to reduce the power consumption of the chip by reducing the length of the wires and the number of gates that are switched.

#### FloorPlanning Constrains in Digital VLSI Systems
There are three main constraints regarding the floorplanning in digital VLSI systems, illustrated in the following table:
|Constraint|Details|
|-|-|

- The notion of storing data on magnetic disks, which the Model 350 pioneered, became the foundation for all subsequent hard drives, solid-state drives, and other forms of mass storage.

The IBM Model 350 Disk File, with its magnetic storage technology and random access capabilities, marked a significant shift in the way data was handled and stored. It may have been a technological behemoth by today's standards, but it was a revolutionary step forward in its time, laying the groundwork for the storage solutions that we rely on in the digital age. üìÄüíæüîç

# The Chip Manufacturing Process
let's embark on a journey to illustrate the chip manufacturing process, a marvel of modern technology that transforms raw silicon wafers into powerful integrated circuits. 

![Chip Manufacturing Process](https://slideplayer.com/5218297/16/images/slide_1.jpg)

We shall unveil the stages of this intricate process:
1. **Silicon ingot**: A large cylinder of pure silicon.
2. **Slicer**: A machine that cuts the ingot into thin wafers.
3. **Blank wafers**: The wafers are polished to a smooth surface.20 to 40 processing steps: The wafers undergo a series of steps to create the circuits on the chip. These steps include:
   - **Oxidation**: A thin layer of silicon dioxide is grown on the surface of the wafer.
   - **Photolithography**: A pattern of light is projected onto the wafer to create a mask. The areas of the wafer that are not covered by the mask are etched away.
   - **Deposition**: A thin layer of material is deposited onto the wafer.
   - Ion implantation: Ions are implanted into the wafer to change its electrical properties.
4. **Patterned wafers**: The wafers now have the circuits printed on them.
5. **Wafer tester**: The wafers are tested to make sure that the circuits are working properly.
6. **Tested wafer:** The wafers are now ready to be cut into dies.
7. **Dicer**: A machine that cuts the wafers into individual dies.
8. **Tested dies:** The dies are tested to make sure that they are working properly.
9.  **Bond die to package:** The dies are attached to packages.
10. **Packaged dies**: The dies are now encapsulated in packages.
11. Part tester: The packaged dies are tested to make sure that they are working properly.
12. **Tested packaged dies**: The packaged dies are now ready to be shipped to customers.
13. **Ship to customers**: The packaged dies are shipped to customers to be assembled into electronic devices.

## Equations

$$Cost\ per\ die = \frac{Cost\ per\ Wafer}{Dies\ per\ Wafer\ *\ Yield}$$

$$Dies\ per\ Wafer = \frac{Wafer\ Area}{Die\ area}$$

$$Yield = \frac{1}{(1 + (Defects\ per\ area √ó Die\ area/2))^2}$$

### Arguments:
|Argument|Details|
|-|-|
|Cost per Wafer| This is the cost of the raw materials and the manufacturing proicess used to create the Wafer.
|yield| is the percentage of good dies that are produced from a wafer.
|Dies per Wafer * yield Wafer area| This is the number of good dies that can be produced from a single wafer, multiplied by the cost per unit area of the wafer.

### Notes
- The cost per die is not linear because of the way that wafers are processed. The edges of the wafer are typically discarded because they are most likely to have defects. This means that the cost per die is higher for smaller dies.
- In yield equation: This formula takes into account the number of defects per unit area of the wafer and the size of the die.

### Synatic Example
Assumptions:
- Assume that the cost per wafer is $1,000.
- Assume that the dies per wafer is 100.
- Assume that the yield is 80%.
- Assume that the die area is 100 square millimeters.

The cost per die would be calculated as follows:
- Cost per die = (1,000 / 100) √ó 80% √ó 100 = $80

This means that the cost of manufacturing a single chip would be $80.

It is important to note that this is just an example. The actual cost of manufacturing a chip will vary depending on the specific factors involved.

## Mask Layers
### Transistors and Wiring in Layered Construction
In the fascinating art of chip manufacturing, transistors and wiring are constructed in a multi-layered fashion. These layers, typically numbering between 10 to 15, are stacked atop one another in a meticulously orchestrated symphony.

### Mask Layers for Pattern Definition
Each of these successive layers is akin to a page in a masterful tome, with its own unique pattern and purpose. The patterns are defined using a mask, a tool similar to a glass photographic slide. This mask carries the intricate blueprint for the layer's design.

### First Layers for Transistor Definition
The initial chapters of this chip's story, around the first 6 layers, are dedicated to the creation of transistors. Transistors are the sentient gates that make computations and logic operations possible.

### Final Layers for Interconnects (Metal Wiring)
The concluding chapters, spanning the last 6 or so layers, weave a different tale. These layers define the intricate network of metal wires, known as interconnects, that link the transistors together. These metal layers are named with increasing numbers (e.g., m1 [GND/VDD], m2 [input & output]), with each having its unique role.

### Metal Layers for Different Purposes
Each metal layer has its purpose in this grand narrative. Metal 1 (m1) typically serves for essential connections like power and ground (GND/VDD). Metal 2 (m2) often deals with input and output connections, bridging the electronic world to the outside.

### Crossing Layers for Versatility
One of the enchanting aspects of this tale is how wires can cross over different layers, much like characters moving between realms in an epic saga. This ability to traverse and connect various layers empowers the chip with its intricate functionality.

![Chip Manufaturing process](https://d36ae2cxtn9mcr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/12023801/SKhynix_Semiconductor-Front-End-Process-Ep2_Image_02.png)
