# Advanced Computer Network (ACN)
# Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) 

WSN: A WSN is a network composed of tens to thousands of these sensors nodes, which are densely deployed in an unattended environment with the ability to sense, wireless communicate, and computation.

These nodes can perform wireless communication as well as perform sensing and computation (software, hardware, algorithms). Yup, so that makes it quite clear that a Wireless Sensor Network is the combination of these namely sensor techniques, embedded techniques, distributed info processing, and communication mechanisms.


Energy conservation are highly important in WSNs, and actually one of the main limitations in WSN.
- Power conservation could be achieved by appropriate optimization of communication and operation management.
